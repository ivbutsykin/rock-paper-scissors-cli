Rock Paper Scissors against the computer is a classic game where you face off against a virtual opponent. You choose between rock, paper, and scissors, and the computer does the same. The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. It's a simple yet entertaining game of chance!
